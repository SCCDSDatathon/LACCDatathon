    🔭 The Southern California Consortium for Data Science (SCCDS) was established to develop and expand articulated pathways in data science that respond to opportunities in industry, are inclusive of students from a variety of backgrounds—particularly those not historically represented in STEM—and prepare students for success in the ever-widening variety of careers that utilize data science.

    <h4>Consortium goals include:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Creating new Introduction to Data Science courses at SCCDS-affiliated universities and community colleges that articulate across the Consortium.</li>
        <li>Establishing outreach events to promote data science career exploration for students in grades 9-20 (e.g., Datathons, Data Science Careers Days).</li>
        <li>Developing and implementing support initiatives for transfer students to ensure success in data science coursework (e.g., summer bridge programs, learning communities).</li>
        <li>Developing and implementing professional development to equip faculty to teach data science, especially through the incorporation of best practices that are culturally relevant and inclusive, and strategies that are data-informed and promising for closing equity gaps.</li>
    </ul>

    ⚡ Fun fact: **The Aztecs developed a sophisticated number system that used dots (•) to represent 1, bars (—) to represent 5, and a symbol resembling a flag for 20. This vigesimal (base-20) system allowed them to perform complex mathematical calculations and keep accurate records for trade, astronomy, and engineering projects.**
